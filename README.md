# project-ontwerpen-audio amplifier

##Information
my project is a 60W audio amplifier. This project seemed very interesting to me from the many different projects that we could choose from the elektor magazines. As an assignment we had to draw the schematic of the project in Altium and also order every component that is present in the circuit.

This is the 60W audio amplifier.
